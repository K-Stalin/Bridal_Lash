This is a simple frontend application that allows the admin to perform basic operations on updating makeup prices, without the need for MongoDB or Node.jsâ€”just a JSON web server.


# Requirements

Before running the Application make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

  - JSON Web server
  - Postman

You can install and run these dependencies using the following command:

   ```
       >> npm install -g json-server
       >> json-server --watch data.json --port 3000
